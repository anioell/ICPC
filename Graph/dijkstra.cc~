/* Dijkstra
 ** |E|\log |V|
 * Finds the shortest paths from one vertex to every other vertex in the graph (SSSP).\\
 * For negative weights, add |min|+1 to each edge, later subtract from result.\\
 * To get a different shortest path when edges are ints, add an
 * $\varepsilon=\frac{1}{k+1}$ on each edge of the shortest path of length $k$, run again. \\
 * \emph{Input:} A source vertex $s$ and an adjacency list $G$. \\
 * \emph{Output:} Modified adj. list with distances from s and predcessor vertices set.
